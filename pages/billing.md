# Pricing

Get started for free, and upgrade if you want to keep going.

Paid plans include a base quota for images. If you exceed the included quota, or want to train models, these are billed additional to your plan.

You can reference our up to date pricing by visiting our **[Pricing Page](https://tryleap.ai/pricing)**.

### Free Tier Policy

If you are on the free tier and train a model, it will only be retained for 7 days. Paid accounts can keep their models for up to 30 days. Id you'd like us to host your model for longer, reach out to us at help@tryleap.ai

### How to Upgrade

Log into your account and within the desired project you wish to upgrade, click on the "Upgrade" button on the top navbar.

### Setting a Billing Limit

To set or remove a billing limit on an upgraded project simply head over to the "Usage" section in your project (click on the Usage button on the top right corner), and then scroll down to Billing Limit.

By setting a billing limit, any API or dashboard requests that exceed the limit you set will automatically fail.

This is useful while developing to prevent runaway code, or in production to control your costs.

You can cancel any time by logging into your account on Leap, clicking on the "View Usage" button within your project, and then selecting "Manage Account".

Note: you will be billed for usage incurred before your cancellation.
