# Terms of Ownership / Copyright

At Leap, we understand that our users are concerned about owning the creations they generate using the machine learning models accessible through our platform. In this article, we provide clear and transparent information to help you make informed decisions about your work.

## Leap is a Hosting Solution

Leap is a hosting provider for open-source and proprietary machine learning models. While we provide a space for developers and users to access and utilize these models, we do not determine the licenses or ownership restrictions around them.

## You Own Your Work

We believe that the work you produce is your own, and we do not claim any ownership or intellectual property rights over it. You are free to use, modify, or distribute your creations in any way that you see fit.

## Licenses and Restrictions

It is important to note that the machine learning models (such as Stable Diffusion) hosted on our platform may have their own licenses and restrictions that apply to your use of them. These licenses may include specific guidelines on how the models can be used, modified, or distributed. To avoid any legal or ethical issues, we strongly recommend reviewing and complying with these guidelines before incorporating any models into your work.

## Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards

At Leap, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct. We encourage our users to do the same. By complying with the licenses and restrictions on our platform, you can ensure that your creations are legal, ethical, and respectful of the intellectual property of others.

## Model Retention Policy

30-Day Retention: We store your trained machine learning models for 30 days post-training. This timeframe is chosen to balance user needs with the high cost of data storage.

Unrestricted Access: Within these 30 days, you have full access to your models, as long as you adhere to the licensing terms.

Automatic Deletion: After 30 days, your model is automatically deleted from our systems, in line with our resource management strategy.

No Storage Beyond 30 Days: We do not offer extended storage for models beyond the 30-day period. Please ensure you extract any needed data from your models before this deadline.

## Summary

In summary, Leap provides a platform for users to access and utilize machine learning models, but we do not determine ownership or licensing of these models. Users own the creations they generate and are responsible for reviewing and complying with the licenses and restrictions of the models they use.
